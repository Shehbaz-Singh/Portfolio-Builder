              into the password. We also record when you agreed to the Terms and Privacy Policy, and
              which version.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Your portfolio content:</strong> everything you type into the dashboard: your
              name, tagline, About text, location, links (including any email address or phone
              number you add), skills, jobs, projects, education, your own custom sections, the
              posts and article links you write (drafts included), your page address, and your
              choices of theme, accent color and availability badge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Your photo,</strong> if you upload one (JPG, PNG or WebP, up to 2 MB). We crop
              it to a square and keep a 400 × 400 pixel copy. The same goes for the optional cover
              image of a post (cropped to 1200 × 630).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Testimonials,</strong> if you let visitors send them: the name, role, company
              and message a visitor writes, and an email address if they choose to give one. They
              wait for your approval, and the email is only ever shown to you.

              Our server reads the text out of the PDF in memory. The file itself is{' '}

              log its contents.
            </li>

              That text is sent to {provider ? <strong>{provider}</strong> : 'an AI provider'} to be
              turned into structured details (name, jobs, skills and so on).
            </li>
            <li>
              The result comes back to you to check and edit. Nothing from it is saved to your
              account until you save it yourself. AI can make mistakes, so please read it before
              saving.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The AI provider processes the text under its own terms and privacy policy, and may keep
            it for a period. Some providers, especially on free plans, may use submitted content to
            improve their products. For example, with Google’s free Gemini plan, Google may use what
            you send to improve its products, and people at Google may read it. Please don’t upload
            a resume you wouldn’t be comfortable sharing on those terms.
          </p>

            Only the text of the resume is sent for this feature. Nothing else from your account is

              <strong>Neon</strong> (database): stores your account and portfolio content. Our

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cloudinary</strong> (images): stores and delivers your photo and post cover
              images. Visitors’ browsers load the photo from Cloudinary, so Cloudinary sees their IP
              address when they do.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>{provider ?? 'The AI provider'}</strong> (resume reading): receives resume
              text, as described above.

            <li>
              <strong>Hosting:</strong> the website and the server behind it run on our hosting
              providers. Hosting providers see requests and keep ordinary server logs.

              <strong>One cookie, “session”:</strong> keeps you signed in. It is needed for the
              dashboard to work, only readable by our servers (not by page scripts), and expires
              after your login does (7 days by default). It is set only if you log in or register.

              <strong>Two small notes in your browser’s local storage</strong> (“onboarding-done”
              and “celebrated”, each tied to your profile): they remember that you have already seen
              the welcome tour and the first-publish message, so we don’t show them again. They
              never leave your browser.
