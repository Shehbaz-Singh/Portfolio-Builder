          the content or your account, apart from short-lived backups.

          You promise that you have the right to share what you post, that it is accurate, and that
          it does not break anyone’s rights or the rules below. If you add a testimonial from
          someone, you are responsible for having their permission and for what it says.

          Terms or the law, if someone credibly reports a problem, or if it puts the service or
          other people at risk. Where we reasonably can, we will tell you why and give you a chance
