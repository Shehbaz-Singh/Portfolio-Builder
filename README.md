## About

Parichay (परिचय) is the Hindi word for "introduction". It is a web app that turns your resume, or a few details you type in, into a clean portfolio page at your own address, like `yoursite.com/your-name`. There is no design work and no hosting to set up. You choose a theme, add your projects and publish.

It is a full-stack TypeScript project: a Next.js frontend, an Express API, a PostgreSQL database, and a shared package of validation schemas that both sides use.

## Features

**Build your page**

- **Resume import.** Upload a PDF and your details, links, skills, jobs, education and projects are filled in for you to review. Nothing is saved until you say so, and the PDF itself is never stored.
- **Live preview.** See your page change as you type, at phone, tablet or desktop width, using the same theme your visitors will see. Changes save automatically.
- **Five themes, any accent color.** Editorial, Bento, Soft, Executive and Creative, each with its own fonts. Text colors adjust so your page stays readable on any accent.
- **Sections you control.** Show, hide, rename and reorder sections, and add your own, like Certifications, Awards or Open source. Hiding a section keeps what you wrote in it.
- **Writing.** Publish short posts in Markdown with a cover image, or link to articles you wrote elsewhere. Each post gets its own page and share image.
- **Testimonials.** Let visitors leave one, and approve each before it appears. Their email is never public.
- **Availability badge.** Say you are open to work, freelance or collaboration, with a message of your own.

**Share it**

- One link to copy, a share menu, and a downloadable **QR code** for a printed resume.
- A **Download resume (PDF)** button, made from your page in the look of your theme: real selectable text, your section order, and only the links you show. You can switch it off.
- Proper link previews when the page is shared, and a sitemap for posts.

**Stay in control**

- **Export** everything you added as a file, or **delete** your account and all of it, at any time.
- A new page stays private until you switch on Publish, and unpublished and missing pages look the same.

![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-CB3837?style=flat&logo=npm&logoColor=white)

It is an npm workspaces monorepo, and the `shared` package holds the Zod schemas that both the frontend and the backend use.

### How it fits together

```
parichay/
├── frontend/   Next.js app: landing page, public portfolio pages, dashboard
├── backend/    Express API, Prisma schema and migrations, seed script
├── shared/     Zod schemas and types used by both sides
└── docs/       Brand guide: palette, fonts, logo and voice
```

A few choices worth knowing:

- **The login token lives in an httpOnly cookie.** The browser never calls the API directly. The site forwards requests and attaches the token, so scripts on the page can never read it.
- **Everything is validated on the server** with the shared schemas, and the API never returns password hashes or other people's data.
- **Themes are real components.** Each one receives the whole public profile and draws it. The dashboard preview and the landing page use the same code.
- **Built for a sleepy free-tier backend.** Slow responses show a "waking up" message, reads retry, and a failed save keeps what you typed.
- **Public pages are cached briefly**, and the cache is cleared the moment you save.
- **Safe by default.** Links accept only http(s), email and phone formats. Uploads are checked by their actual contents. Markdown is rendered without raw HTML. Logins and uploads are rate limited per visitor.
- **Accessible.** Built to WCAG 2.2 AA: contrast, visible focus, keyboard support, reduced motion and a skip link.

## Getting started

You need Node 20 or newer and a PostgreSQL database (a free Neon project works). Cloudinary and Gemini keys are optional: without them, uploads and resume import are simply unavailable.

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install

# 2. Configure (each file explains its settings)
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local

# 3. Create the tables, and optionally add the demo profiles
npm run prisma:deploy -w @parichay/backend
npm run db:seed -w @parichay/backend

# 4. Run everything: API on :4000, site on :3000
npm run dev
```

| Command             | What it does                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run dev`       | Builds `shared`, then runs all three in watch    |
| `npm run build`     | Production build of shared, backend and frontend |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-checks the backend and frontend             |
| `npm run lint`      | ESLint across the repo                           |
| `npm run format`    | Prettier (`format:check` only checks)            |

### Demo profiles

The seed script adds five demo portfolios, one for each theme, so you can see what a page looks like: `tanisha-walia` (Editorial), `ayush-gill` (Bento), `syed-abraar` (Soft), `sameer-bhatia` (Executive) and `navjot-singh` (Creative). Their content lives in `shared/src/samples.ts`. Running the seed again refreshes them and touches nothing else. They are labeled "Sample profile" on their pages, nobody can sign in as them, and their addresses are reserved.
