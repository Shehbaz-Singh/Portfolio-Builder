## Say what you see before what you think

“The button is grey and sits below the fold” is something the designer can check. “This feels off” is not. Start with what you observe, then say what you think it causes.

## Ask what the work is meant to do

A screen can be handsome and still fail at its job. Before giving an opinion, ask: *who is this for, and what should they be able to do?*

## Keep it to a few points

Five comments that matter beat twenty that do not. If you have many, sort them and share the top three.

## Offer a direction, not an order

“Could the price be closer to the button?” leaves room for the designer to find an answer. “Move the price” does not.

Critique is a conversation. If both people leave knowing what to try next, it did its job.`,
